# LLM Projects
Experimenting with large language models and applications in automation and engineering productivity.

Setup:
Note at the time of writing, the best python version for llm projects is 11.13.* but I will be working with 13.4. If we encounter challenges, we will navigate through it.

1. Create directory for your project on terminal and cd into the directory
```
mkdir llm_projects
cd llm_projects
```

2. Create a virtual environment
```
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
